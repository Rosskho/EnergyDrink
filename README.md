Tired of hearing complaints about sleep in your server? So were we.

Sleep is essential in any survival game—but some players just can’t handle it. For those delicate souls, we've brewed up a solution.

Energized! adds powerful energy drinks to Project Zomboid that give players a much-needed stamina boost and reduce their fatigue. With customizable sandbox options, you can fine-tune the strength, spawn rate, and even enable optional addiction effects for a more balanced experience.

Whether you're trying to stay awake during a late-night looting run or you're just allergic to beds, this mod has your back.
